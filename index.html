            Roble Ventures is a startup venture fund focused on the future of work and learning.
            As one of the first employees I helped the GP with many parts of the fundraising and research.
            My work centered around sourcing research, crafting the investment thesis, and identifying LPs for the first fund.
            Working at Roble gave me insight into the most impactful ideas enterting the market and how those ideas become companies.

          <h2 class="sub-heading">A little about me</h2>

          <p>
            I was born in San Francisco and raised outside of Stanford University.
            There I was introduced to computer science and started teaching myself to code.
            Coding was a quiet passion, eclipsed by sports and school.
            Rugby was my favorite (still is) but I won a couple swim meets.
            Did enough academic research at Yale to know I was a meant to build not study.
            I capped off high school earning my Eagle Scout before locking our doors for the pandemic.
            In the new spare time I got a job working for a startup VC.
            This was my first real exposure to the world of startups;
            the GP had the vision to look ahead like no-one I met before.
            Sourcing leads for the firm and talking to him I saw a world ten-twenty plus years ahead of the status quo.
            Keeping momentum I now work for Purdue's growth stage accelerator and involve heavily in our entrepeneurship community.
            <br><br>
            I'm an engineer at heart. I love to build and love to hear about what people are building.
            Making drinks is a side passion of mine, coffee, tea, ...; exploring the outdoors as well.
            I have a goal of seeing as many landmarks and wilderness as possible before I gradutate.
            <br><br>
            I love coffee, tea, and other breakfast items so if you're in the area (I go to Purdue University in West Lafayette Indiana) or just want to connect and chat feel free to reach out!
